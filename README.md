# reddit-ironic-language-detection

This repository is a sklearn implementation of *Sparse, Contextually Informed Models for Irony Detection: Exploiting User Communities, Entities and Sentiment* (Wallace et al., 2015). This paper seeks to fit a binary classification model for verbal irony detection in online content (in this case, Reddit). The fully featurized model with thread context (more on this below) is compared against a baseline bag-of-words (BOW) model.
